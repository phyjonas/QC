Notes for gate based quantum computing.
Each notebook is designed so that it could serve as additional material for a course on quantum computing.
All algorithms are implemented using cirq. For many of those (potentially all), there exists a (most likely better) implementation on Cirq's GitHub.
Whenever there is a reference to a chapter inside a book, it refers to "An Introduction to Quantum Computing" by Phillip Kaye, Raymond Laflamme, Michele Mosca, which I found very insightful.
If you find a mistake please let me know.
This is very much work in progress but will be updated semi-regularly
